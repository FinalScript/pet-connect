## How We Built It

Pet Connect was crafted using a combination of powerful technologies. React Native CLI was used for building the mobile app's interface, while Tailwind CSS provided a clean and efficient styling approach. Apollo GraphQL facilitated seamless communication between the frontend and backend, enabling optimized queries and mutations. Express.js served as the robust backend framework, managing user data and interactions in conjunction with MySQL for efficient data storage. Authentication was handled securely through Auth0 and JWT, ensuring user privacy and data security. Docker was leveraged for containerization, streamlining deployment and ensuring consistency across environments.
